However, because data collection was started late for 2022-04-22, it was not until 2022-04-23 that there was a full day of data; similarly, we would need to collect through 2022-05-04 and not 2022-05-05, since 2022-05-05 would not have a full day's worth of data. Therefore, it is important to retrieve data collected between 2022-04-23 and 2022-05-04 in order to analyze data collected full days only. When more data is collected, I would recommend querying results by week in order to determine what the wait time averages are per week, which could inform which rides Disneyland should advertise more the next week."

    "From this query, we can see that the average wait time for rides in Disneyland is approximately 25.15 minutes. This is important to understand because we can compare rides to see which rides have a longer or shorter wait than average, and by how much. However, because this average is around 25 minutes, which may cause disatisfaction with park attendees, I think that Disneyland should determine which rides have less than average wait times and increase marketing for those rides. By encouraging attendees to go to rides with smaller wait times, this may decrease the wait times of larger rides. Alternatively, Disney could increase advertising spending for their Genie Plus service due to larger wait times, which may increase revenue but potentially cause lines to become longer."

This query is important because it allows Disney to identify which rides are more popular and have longer wait times. With an understanding of how each ride compares to the average, Disney can boost marketing efforts for their rides with lower wait times; this would increase wait times for rides below average and decrease rides with wait times above average."

    "From this data, we are able to see that the rides with the longest average wait times (while open) are Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, Space Mountain, Indiana Jones Adventure, and Matterhorn Bobsleds, while the rides with the shortest wait times are The Disneyland Story presenting Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln, Mark Twain Riverboat, Sailing Ship Columbia, and Enchanted Tiki Room. In order to reduce the wait times for rides with the longest average wait time, Disney should look at rides with shorter wait times that are close by and increase marketing for those rides. For example, because Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance has the longest wait, Disney should increase its advertising for Millenium Falcon: Smugglers Run; even though both have above average wait times, increasing marketing efforts for the Millenium Falcon ride may create more excitement for that ride, potentially decreasing the wait time for Rise of the Resistance. Similarly, with Space Mountain, Disney could increase marketing for nearby rides that have below average wait times, like Star Tours - The Adventures Continue, in order to elongate the wait time for the shorter rides and shorten the wait time for the longer wait time rides. Therefore, Disney should look at the average wait times for rides and compare them to the average; they should then use this information to market rides with shorter wait times in order to create more excitement for those rides, potentially decreasing wait times for more popular rides."

By identifying and ranking the rides that are open most often, Disney can further adjust its marketing strategy by advertising rides that are open more often; this will prevent customers for feeling frustrated or upset if a ride advertised as open ended up being closed."

    "From this query, we can see that Star Tours - The Adventures Continue, Millenium Falcon: Smugglers Run, Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters, Astro Orbitor, and Mad Tea Party are among the rides that have been open most often, being open for more than 97% of the time the past 11 days. On the other hand, we can see that there are many rides that have not been open hardly at all in the past 11 days or so, such as Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, and Star Wars Launch Bay, of several. With the rates that rides are open and the average wait times for open rides, Disney can better identify and select the best rides to advertise in order to reduce wait times for the most popular rides. For instance, in order to reduce the wait time for Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, the Disney should advertise the Millenium Falcon: Smugglers Run ride not only because the wait time is lower than 40 minutes (which is over 30 minutes shorter than Rise of the Resistance) but also because according to this query, the ride is open around 99% of the time, meaning that it has been open nearly all hours that the park has been open in the past 11 days. In addition, if Disney were looking to reduce wait times for Space Mountain, this query would demonstrate that Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters and Astro Orbiter have both been open around 98% of the time in the past 11 days, meaning that they would be reliable rides to market. Therefore, I would recommend that Disney look at both the wait times and the amount of time that the rides are open in order to advertise rides with lower wait times and high open rates, potentially lowering the wait time for Disneyland's more popular rides."

This query is important because it allows Disney to understand the ride wait time extremes and the range between them. If rides have ranges that are greater than 60 minutes, then Disney should focus on marketing rides with lower wait times in order to ensure that maximum wait times can be reduced."

    "From this query, we can understand that the majority of rides (while they are open) have a wait time difference less than 60 minutes, or an hour. However, there are multiple rides that have very high maximums wait times, such as Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance with 180 minutes, Space Mountain with 150 minutes, and Splash Mountain with 135 minutes, to name a few. Ultimately, for all rides that have a wait time difference greater than 60, Disney needs to identify rides that have a smaller wait time difference in order reduce the more popular rides' wait times. For instance, in the case of the Matterhorn, Disney could consider marketing rides like Mad Tea Party, Snow White's Scary Adventures, and Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. Ultimately, I would recommend that Disney use Average Wait Time, Open Rate, and the difference between maximum and minimum wait times (and whether that number is greater than 60) in order to determine rides with low wait times that are close to the most popular rides. Then, Disney could use some of its marketing resources in order to advertise rides that have lower wait times, higher open rates, and smaller differences between their maximum and minimum times. This will allow Disney to increase popularity for their less popular rides, effectively lowering the wait times for their most popular rides and making them more accessible for park attendees.\n",
